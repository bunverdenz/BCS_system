This is cinema website implementation. We use node.js with SQL on server side. In order to use data schema and SQL Query in real-world data, cinema data which contains Movies, Users, Halls, Tickets, Ticket Type, Shows, and Stars tables could be represented clearly with connection such as Foreign Key between each table.
